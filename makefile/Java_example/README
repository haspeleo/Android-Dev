PNZ is a JAVA script which plays the PNZ game.

The program picks a random 3 digit number, with all digits distinct. The player types a 3 digit guess, and the program prints a "P" for each digit that is in the correct location, an "N" for each digit that occurs in the answer, but in a different location, and a "Z" if no digit was correct.

// Once GraphViz installed, write a dot file 
// visualize it with GraphViz
// Save this code in a file called hello.dot. You can then generate the graph and display it with a simple one-liner:
// $ dot hello.dot -Tps | gv -
// The -Tps option generates PostScript code, which is then piped to the ghostview utility.
// If you're satisfied with the output, save it to a file:
// $ dot hello.dot -Tps -o hello.ps

//comment: hello world with dot 
//graph with a single node Node1

graph Hello {

Node1 [label = "Hello World !"]

}
